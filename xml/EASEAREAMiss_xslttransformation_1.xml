      <abstract>Easement datasets received from states are brought into ArcMap to assess projection and validity. Re-projected as needed. Easements with inaccurate or missing attribute data are returned to the states through a check in/check out procedure. 100% of easement state layers, merged with the national easement authoritative easement layer have the proper attribution.Ongoing effort to correct and standardize attributes and identify geometry issues such as overlaps - input from the states required to resolve most of these issues and acquired through a check in/check out procedure.Loaded into SDE.</abstract>
      <purpose>Vector dataset provides an aggregate layer of conservation easements received from each state  used to identify, monitor, and enhance the spatial accuracy of restoration program polygons.  Includes all US states, territories and possessions.
